### Summary of Your Work on the Odoo and PostgreSQL Docker Setup

1. **Initial Setup and Configuration:**
   - Created a shell script (`start-odoo.sh`) to automate the deployment of Odoo and PostgreSQL using Docker and Docker Compose.
   - Developed a Docker Compose template (`docker-compose.yml.template`) to define the services, networks, and volumes required for Odoo and PostgreSQL.
   - Implemented a Flask web application (`app.py`) with an HTML form (`index.html`) to accept user input for Odoo version, PostgreSQL version, and port number.
   - Ensured the shell script validates user inputs and checks for port availability.

2. **Docker Compose Template:**
   - Defined PostgreSQL and Odoo services with environment variables for versions.
   - Configured volumes for persistent data storage for PostgreSQL and Odoo.
   - Used a network bridge to allow communication between services.

3. **Automation Enhancements:**
   - Updated the shell script to check for specific log messages indicating that Odoo has started successfully.
   - Implemented logic to copy filestore data into the Odoo container after it is fully initialized.
   - Ensured the Flask application waits for the container setup to complete before redirecting to the Odoo web page.

4. **Persistent Data Handling:**
   - Adjusted Docker Compose configuration to ensure the PostgreSQL data is stored in a named volume (`pgdata`) for persistence.
   - Modified initialization scripts to avoid re-initializing the database if it already exists.
   - Used Docker volumes to ensure the database and Odoo data persist across container restarts.

### Key Components and Files

1. **Shell Script (`start-odoo.sh`):**
   - Validates input parameters and checks port availability.
   - Configures environment variables for Docker Compose.
   - Uses Docker Compose to start the containers.
   - Waits for Odoo to be fully initialized before proceeding.
   - Copies filestore data into the Odoo container.

2. **Docker Compose Template (`docker-compose.yml.template`):**
   - Defines services for Odoo and PostgreSQL.
   - Configures environment variables and volumes for persistent data storage.
   - Sets up a network for service communication.

3. **Flask Application (`app.py`):**
   - Hosts a web page for user input.
   - Executes the shell script with user-provided parameters.
   - Waits for container setup completion and redirects to the Odoo web page.

4. **HTML Form (`index.html`):**
   - Collects user input for Odoo version, PostgreSQL version, and port number.
   - Submits the data to the Flask application.

5. **Initialization Scripts (`init-db`):**
   - Contains SQL scripts to initialize the PostgreSQL database.
   - Ensures the database is not re-initialized if it already exists.

### Current Status

- The system works perfectly in terms of launching Odoo and PostgreSQL containers via the web interface.
- The database remains persistent across container restarts.
- The Flask application correctly waits for the Odoo container to be fully set up before redirecting the user.
